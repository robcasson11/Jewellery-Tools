## Weight Converter

Use case...

A customer would like a price to replicate their silver ring in platinum. Platinum is a heavier metal than silver and to work out the cost a weight conversion needs to take place. Once the weight has been converted we can determine the cost of the metal (platinum) needed to replicate the ring. 

This converter takes any weight of any metal and displays the converted weight in all other metals available. A weight for "wax" is also included since building items (rings/models) in wax is a traditional technique still used.
